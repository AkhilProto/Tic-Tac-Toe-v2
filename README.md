# Tic-Tac-Toe-v2
The same Tic-Tac-Toe which is playable in the CLI(Command Line Prompt), but now with the addition of a new AI!!

Sure, here is a README.md file for your Tic-Tac-Toe game v2 with AI:

## Tic-Tac-Toe Game v2 with AI

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game that can be played against a computer AI. The AI is based on a simple minimax algorithm, and it is able to play at a fairly high level.

To play the game, simply click on a square on the board to make your move. The AI will then make its move, and the game will continue until one player wins or the game is a draw.

The AI is able to win about 60% of the time, so it is a fairly challenging opponent. If you are looking for a more challenging game, then you can try playing against the AI.

## How to Install

To install the game, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/AkhilProto/Tic-Tac-Toe-v2.git
```

Once the repository has been cloned, you can run the game by typing the following command in your terminal:

```
python main.py
```

## How to Play

The game is played on a 3x3 grid. To make a move, simply click on a square on the board. The AI will then make its move, and the game will continue until one player wins or the game is a draw.

## Winning Conditions

A player wins the game by getting three of their marks in a row. The marks can be arranged horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Draw Conditions

The game is a draw if all of the squares on the board are filled and neither player has three of their marks in a row.
